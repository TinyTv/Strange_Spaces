(open this file for a better reading experience)

This is the gitHub repository for Strange Spaces, a demo PC project for the Pelifarmi project. 
The project was done inbetween lessons during 3 months by a team of 2-6 people. (The team started with 2 people, then grew later on).
The team had no prior experience in game development. 
The programming and assembling of the demo project was done mostly during the last 3 weeks of Pelifarmi (~90hrs).
Strange Spaces was released with some bugs - our lead programmer is working on fixing the worst of them on her spare time. 

"Strange Spaces is a grid-based real-time 2D action exploration game for PC. The game is set in a desolate sci-fi world where an unknown presence has appeared. The main character is sent to investigate the anomaly."

The current executable (preview_001) is meant to be used for portfolio work and demonstration ONLY. You can download the zip from the TESTING folder (which is the Gamemaker project folder). It is not to be released elsewhere for commercial use.
The demo has 5 levels

Controls: 
WASD - movement 
Shift = dash (dashes over one tile in the direction the player character is facing)
Space = shoot (one tile range)
Arrow keys = change face direction (shoots and dashes in this direction)
R = restart 

The team:
Milla - lead programmer, producer, team leader, audio
Tuomas - designer, lead artist (player character, base environment)
Ivan - designer, artist (enemy art and animation, environmental details)
Jyri - programming (worm enemies)
Sonja - level building
Esa - programming (cell enemies)
