# Strange_Spaces

This is the gitHub repository for Strange Spaces, a student project for the Pelifarmi project. 
The project was done inbetween lessons during 3 months by a team of 2-6 people. (The team started with 2 people, then grew later on).
The programming and assembling of the demo project was done mostly during the last 3 weeks of Pelifarmi.
Strange Spaces was released with several major bugs - our lead programmer is working on fixing them on her spare time. 

The current executable (preview_001) is meant to be used for portfolio work and demonstration ONLY. 
It is not to be released elsewhere for commercial use.

The team:
Milla - lead programmer, producer, team leader
Tuomas - designer, lead artist (player character, base environment)
Ivan - designer, artist (enemy art and animation, environmental details)

Jyri - programming (worm enemies)
Sonja - level building
Esa - programming (cell enemies)
